# Tableau Homework - Citi Bike Analytics

## Background

Congratulations on your new job! As the new lead analyst for the [New York Citi Bike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Bike) Program, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

## Task

**The ask in this assignment was to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs (https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) and find two unexpected phenomena.** 

**2-5 visualizations were designed for each discovered phenomena (4-10 total). A timespan of Jan 2019 to Dec 2019 was chosen to work with.** 


Data was cleaned and prepped using Jupyter Notebook.

**The following are some questions that were tackled:**

* How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?

* By what percentage has total ridership grown?

* How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months?

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?

* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey?

* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey?

* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? 

* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey

* Today, what is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?

* How effective has gender outreach been in increasing female ridership over the timespan?

* How does the average trip duration change by age?

* What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?

* Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan?

* How variable is the utilization by bike ID?

**Next, the following was completed:**

* The above visualizations were used to design a dashboard for each phenomena.

* The dashboards are accompanied with an analysis explaining why the phenomena may be occuring. 

* **Basic:** A static map was created that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.

* A Tableau story was created that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards.
